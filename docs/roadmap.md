# SimpleExplorer — Roadmap

Forward-looking backlog and honest MVP audit. Architecture / current
state lives in [`design.md`](./design.md); repository conventions live
in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). This file is the source of truth for
**what's painted but not wired**, and **what hasn't been started**.

Status: post-MVP, pre-v1. Phases 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b, 7, 8a have
shipped. **Phase 8b (embedded PTY terminal via ConPTY + xterm.js) was
reverted** — see the dedicated section below — and replaced with
three external-launcher actions (Open in Terminal / PowerShell / Cmd)
that spawn at the active pane's path. The Workspace direction has
been removed; the remaining directions are Fluent (A) and Cmd (B).
Remaining Phase 8 work:
**8c** copy/move progress + conflict UI + cancellation, **8d**
selection keyboard ergonomics (Ctrl+A, Shift+arrows), and
**8e** in-app dialogs to replace the native `prompt()` /
`confirm()` that breaks the Mica chrome. After that,
**Phase 9 Crew (Copilot CLI) integration** (shell out to the
`crew` binary so users can ask natural-language questions about
the file they're looking at), plus the items in [Open questions
/ debt](#open-questions--debt).

## Shipped

- **Phase 6a — Quick UX wins + Cmd rail redesign.** Esc clears the
  active pane selection; status bars show a byte-sum of selected
  files; F2 triggers an inline rename input on the row instead of
  a `prompt()` modal; Ctrl+L opens the palette pre-filled with the
  active pane's path; `npm run build` auto-copies
  `extras/shellhelp.exe` into `dist/`. Direction B's rail follows
  the Claude Design redesign — vertical icon + label, Pinned dropped,
  click-to-explain detail panel showing recents / drives / docs /
  downloads.
- **Phase 5 — sort + view modes.** Each tab carries `sort: { key, dir }`
  and `view` (`details` / `compact` / `tiles`). Folders cluster
  first; the comparator handles `name` (locale-aware,
  case-insensitive) / `size` / `modified` / `type`. Fluent's
  column-header cells (`cols__seg`) are clickable — same-key click
  toggles asc/desc; Fluent's command bar gained an `a-view`
  segmented chooser before the layout picker. Cmd's pane-header
  Sort and View buttons open generic `.popover` overlays.
  Compact = denser padding on the same grid; Tiles = wrapping
  flex grid of 92 × 88 px cells with the column header hidden.
  Persistence: `tabSnapshot` now serializes `{ path, sort, view }`,
  and `createPaneState` accepts both legacy string seeds and the
  new shape.
- **Phase 1 — chrome wiring** (commit `0b7242e`). Fluent window
  controls, clickable breadcrumbs, Direction B rail navigation, dynamic
  drives section in the Fluent sidebar (real free-space numbers from
  `fs.listDrives()`).
- **Phase 4 — Cmd palette + tab affordances + resize smoothness.**
  Direction B's static input is now a real Ctrl+K palette
  (`src/palette.js`) with three modes inferred from the query:
  `> …` runs a `doAction` verb; `/`, `\`, or a `<X>:` drive prefix
  triggers debounced directory autocomplete via `fs.listDir`;
  anything else searches current-pane entries and recents.
  `↑ / ↓` move highlight, Enter executes, Esc / outside-click
  dismisses. Global Ctrl+K focuses the palette only when Cmd is
  active. `doAction` gained `tabNew` / `tabClose` shims so the
  palette can dispatch them via the existing `explorer:action`
  channel. Middle-click on a Fluent tab now closes it
  (Chrome / VS Code convention); the close × stays the visible
  affordance. Pane resize now coalesces mousemove updates to one
  per animation frame and suppresses `.row` pointer events during
  the drag, eliminating the choppiness that shipped with Phase 3
  on long file lists.
- **Phase 3 — folder-background right-click + resizable panes**.
  Right-clicking the empty area of a pane opens a folder-scope menu
  (Open in VS Code · Open in Terminal · New folder · Refresh · Show
  in Explorer · Properties), with the OS shell extensions filling
  in below for the folder itself via `helperMenu([pane.path])`.
  `app.js` gained a `refresh` action; `reveal` now falls back to
  `openInOS(pane.path)` when nothing is selected. A new
  `src/layout.js` module owns `LAYOUT_DEFS` + `applyLayout()`,
  which sets the grid template with a 6 px gutter track between
  panes and inserts splitter divs there; drag updates a CSS-var
  ratio (clamped 0.1 – 0.9), commits to `settings.splits[layoutId]`
  on mouseup, persists under `simple-explorer.state.splits`. Both
  directions now route through `applyLayout` instead of setting
  `gridTemplateColumns/Rows` themselves. Live-resize smoothness
  was tightened up post-merge in Phase 4.
- **Phase 2 — real multi-tabs per pane**. Each Fluent pane now owns a
  tab list (`pane.tabs`); each tab has its own path, history,
  selection, entries, and filter. `+` opens a new tab at the active
  tab's path; `×` closes a tab (hidden when only one tab remains —
  closing the last tab is a no-op, layout-driven pane removal stays
  in Phase 6). State persists under `simple-explorer.tabs` and is
  rehydrated on launch; non-active tabs lazy-list their entries on
  first switch.
- **Phase 1.5 — full Windows shell context menu**. Two new helper
  verbs in `tools/shellhelp.cpp` (`menu` walks `IContextMenu` →
  emits a JSON tree; `invoke` calls `InvokeCommand` for the chosen
  verb id). `src/pane.js` now renders the curated SimpleExplorer
  items at the top, then asynchronously fills shell-extension entries
  underneath, with hover-spawn submenus, a 3-second TTL cache, and
  graceful fallback to the legacy curated-only list when the helper
  isn't compiled. Helper still needs an MSVC build pass on a Windows
  box (`tools/build.md`) to ship the binary.

## Known bugs

- **`extras/shellhelp.exe` not yet compiled.** Right-click → Properties /
  Delete-to-trash / drive list fall back to PowerShell (~250–400 ms vs
  ~50 ms native). Build once with MSVC; `scripts/run.ps1` automates from
  there.

## MVP audit

### Wired (works)

- Direction switcher (A · Fluent / B · Cmd)
- Theme toggle (light ↔ dark, per direction)
- Layout picker (1, 2v, 2h, 3, 4 panes)
- Back / Forward / Up navigation per pane
- Search input (filters visible rows in the active pane)
- Type-to-jump in the active pane (Windows Explorer style)
- Row click (select), double-click (open), right-click (custom menu)
- Pane click sets active pane
- Clickable breadcrumb segments
- Fluent window controls: minimize and close (maximize uses the OS title bar)
- Right-click actions: Open, Open in VS Code, Open in Terminal,
  Copy path, Rename, Delete, Show in Explorer, Properties
- Fluent command bar buttons: New folder · Copy · Rename · Delete · Compare
- Fluent sidebar quick-access + dynamic drives — click navigates active pane
- Recent items in Fluent sidebar — click navigates
- Direction B rail navigation (Home / Downloads / Docs)
- Real Windows Properties dialog (via `extras/shellhelp.exe` when built;
  PowerShell fallback otherwise)
- Recycle Bin via `IFileOperation` (helper) or
  `Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO` (fallback)

### Painted but not wired (the gap)

These render and look right, but clicking them does nothing today:

| Where | Element | Should do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direction B | Rail icons (Pinned / Recent / Drives) | open popover panels |
| Direction B | Pane header More button | placeholder; no menu yet |

### Not started — explicitly out of MVP scope

- Tree view (left of the row list, expandable folders)
- Column view (Finder-style cascading panes)
- Recursive search (only filter visible rows in MVP)
- Drag-and-drop from / to stock Windows Explorer
- Custom Win11 Mica title bar chrome (frameless window + own controls)
- Full Windows shell context menu via `IContextMenu`
  (every installed shell extension — Git Bash, 7-Zip, etc.)
- Thumbnails for images / videos
- File preview pane
- Zip-as-folder browsing
- JS lint / test tooling (`eslint` or `biome`, `vitest` or `node:test`)
- Build-step that auto-copies `extras/shellhelp.exe` into `dist/`
- Compiled `extras/shellhelp.exe` itself
  (source ready; needs a one-time MSVC compile)

## Roadmap, sized and prioritized

### ~~Phase 1.5 — Full Windows shell context menu~~ (shipped)

> **Promoted from Phase 7.** The user explicitly wants the right-click
> menu to match stock Explorer (Bosch File Services, FastSearch,
> SWB-Shell, Open with Code, Open Git Bash, 7-Zip, TortoiseSVN, Send to,
> Properties, …) — i.e. every installed shell extension, not the
> curated short list we ship today.

Implementation lives in `tools/shellhelp.cpp` (verbs `menu` + `invoke`)
and `src/pane.js` (curated section + async shell fill + submenus +
cache). Notes preserved below for context; further follow-ups (icons,
keyboard navigation, watchdog timeout for hangy extensions) are tracked
in [Open questions / debt](#open-questions--debt).

#### Approach

Extend the existing native helper (`tools/shellhelp.cpp` →
`extras/shellhelp.exe`) with two new verbs that wrap COM
`IContextMenu`, and replace the static JS menu with an async fetch of
the helper's JSON.

```
shellhelp menu <path> [<path> …]      → JSON tree of menu entries to stdout
shellhelp invoke <id> <path> [<path>…] → invoke command id on path(s)
```

`menu` walks `IShellFolder` from the parent dir, calls `GetUIObjectOf`
to obtain `IContextMenu`, then `QueryContextMenu` into an `HMENU` and
introspects each entry. For submenus (`MFT_SUBMENU`), recursively
expand. Output is JSON for tractable parsing.

`invoke` rebuilds the same `IContextMenu` and calls `InvokeCommand`
with the chosen verb id. Path is required so the helper can rebuild
the COM object (no shared state between calls).

#### Files affected

**Modified**

- **`tools/shellhelp.cpp`** — add ~150 lines for `menu` + `invoke`.
  Skeleton:

  ```cpp
  static HRESULT build_context_menu(int n, wchar_t** paths,
                                    IContextMenu** out_cm,
                                    HMENU* out_hm);
  static int verb_menu(int argc, wchar_t** argv);
  static int verb_invoke(int argc, wchar_t** argv);
  ```

  - `build_context_menu` resolves each path to an `IShellItem`, gets
    the parent `IShellFolder`, and aggregates child PIDLs into one
    `GetUIObjectOf` call so multi-select acts on the union (matches
    Explorer behavior).
  - `verb_menu` calls `QueryContextMenu(hm, 0, MIN_ID, MAX_ID,
    CMF_NORMAL | CMF_EXTENDEDVERBS)` and walks the `HMENU`. For each
    item: read text via `GetMenuStringW`, the verb id via
    `GetMenuItemID`, the canonical verb via
    `IContextMenu::GetCommandString(id, GCS_VERBW, …)`, recurse into
    submenus via `GetSubMenu`. Emit JSON like:

    ```json
    [
      { "id": 1,    "label": "Open",            "verb": "open" },
      { "id": 0,    "label": "",                "separator": true },
      { "id": null, "label": "7-Zip",
        "submenu": [{"id": 102, "label": "Add to archive…", "verb": "..."}] }
    ]
    ```

  - `verb_invoke` rebuilds the menu (cheap on a warm process,
    necessary because the HMENU is stateful) and calls
    `InvokeCommand` with `CMINVOKECOMMANDINFOEX` — pass the parent
    HWND, verb id, and `nShow = SW_SHOWNORMAL`.

- **`src/fs.js`** — add `helperMenu(paths)` and `helperInvoke(id,
  paths)` thin wrappers over `helperAvailable()` + `runHelper()`.
  Mock fallback returns the static curated list so the in-browser
  preview still works.

- **`src/pane.js`** — rewrite `showContextMenu(x, y, entry)`:
  1. Always render the curated SimpleExplorer items (Open in pane,
     Compare panes, Copy path) at the top — these are *ours*, not
     the OS's, and they don't show up in `IContextMenu`.
  2. After the curated items, render a `Loading…` placeholder.
  3. `await helperMenu([paths])`. On success, replace placeholder
     with the parsed JSON. On failure (or when the helper isn't
     compiled), fall back to today's static list.
  4. Submenus open on hover after a 200 ms delay (standard Windows
     menu behavior). Render position auto-flips to the left when a
     submenu would overflow the viewport.
  5. Click handler: SimpleExplorer items route to `doAction()`;
     shell-extension items call `helperInvoke(id, paths)` and
     dismiss the menu.

  Add a small in-memory cache keyed by `paths.join('\0')` with a
  3-second TTL so repeated right-clicks of the same item don't
  re-walk COM.

- **`docs/design.md`** — extend the "Native helpers" table to list
  the two new verbs alongside `properties`, `trash`, `drives`. Note
  that the curated items still live in the JS menu and explain why.

- **`docs/roadmap.md`** — once landed, move this Phase 1.5 entry to
  a "shipped" section.

**Untouched**

- `src/app.js` — the right-click → `doAction()` plumbing is already
  generic (`document.dispatchEvent('explorer:action', { detail })`);
  shell-extension invocations bypass it and call `helperInvoke`
  directly from inside the menu's click handler.

#### Verification

1. Helper rebuild: `cd tools && cl /nologo /EHsc /O2 /utf-8
   shellhelp.cpp /link shell32.lib ole32.lib`. Confirm exe < 100 KB.
2. `shellhelp menu "C:\Workspace\11_AI\SimpleExplorer\README.md"` →
   JSON includes Open, Cut, Copy, Send to, Properties, plus locally
   installed extensions (Open with Code, Git Bash, 7-Zip, TortoiseSVN).
3. `shellhelp invoke <id> "<path>"` invokes the chosen verb.
4. End-to-end in app: right-click a file. Curated items render in
   < 50 ms; shell extensions fill in < 300 ms typical.
5. Multi-select: 3 files → menu matches stock Explorer's 3-file
   menu (subset; multi-incompatible entries hidden). `Send to →
   Compressed folder` produces a single zip.
6. Submenus: hover `Send to` / `7-Zip`, expand after ~200 ms.
7. Perf budget: first paint < 50 ms; shell fill < 300 ms typical,
   < 1 s worst case.
8. Fresh Windows box without 3rd-party extensions: still has OS
   defaults plus curated items.
9. Mock mode (`src/index.html` opened in a browser): curated list
   still renders, no helper required.

#### Risks / gotchas

- **Hangy shell extensions.** Some 3rd-party extensions do I/O or
  RPC during `QueryContextMenu` and can stall multi-second. The
  helper must run with a watchdog (timeout → return partial results
  after 1 s). If a single extension consistently blocks, expose a
  per-CLSID skip-list in `neutralino.config.json`.
- **Icons.** The user's screenshot shows colored icons next to each
  entry. These come from `IExtractIconW` keyed off the registered
  CLSID. Optional v1 — ship text-only first. Followup: helper emits
  base64-encoded 16×16 PNG per item, JS renders inline.
- **Per-file-type menus.** `IContextMenu` returns different items
  for files vs folders vs drives. The helper must always go through
  `IShellFolder` from the *parent* (folder containing the item)
  rather than parsing the item directly, or many extensions don't
  appear.
- **Elevation.** Some verbs (e.g. "Run as administrator") trigger
  UAC. `InvokeCommand` handles this transparently — Windows shows
  the consent prompt — but the helper must use
  `CMIC_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI = 0` (allow UI) for those to surface.
- **Custom verbs without ASCII names.** Use `GetCommandString` with
  `GCS_VERBW` (wide variant). Some shell extensions return
  `E_NOTIMPL` for `GetCommandString` — fall back to invoking by
  numeric id.
- **Menu walk vs invoke pairing.** The HMENU + IContextMenu pair is
  stateful per `QueryContextMenu` call. After enumerating, free
  with `DestroyMenu`. For invoke, rebuild fresh — don't try to
  share state between the two helper invocations.

#### Order of work when implementation resumes

1. Add `verb_menu` to `shellhelp.cpp`, no submenu support yet.
   Smoke test against a few file types.
2. Add submenu recursion + the JSON tree shape.
3. Wire `helperMenu` in `fs.js` + the loading-then-fill flow in
   `pane.js`. Test live.
4. Add `verb_invoke`. Wire click handler in `pane.js`.
5. Add multi-select union.
6. Add the 3-second TTL cache.
7. Add the watchdog timeout for hangy extensions.
8. Update `docs/design.md` and move this entry to "shipped".
9. (Optional) icons — only if time permits.

#### Out of scope (this phase)

- Drag-and-drop into / from stock Explorer.
- Persistent context-menu state (remembering expanded submenus).
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys / Enter). Add later.
- Custom theming of shell-extension icons / labels — ship them as
  the OS provides.
- Full `IContextMenu3` features (themed background, owner-draw).
  Use `IContextMenu` (universally supported); upgrade only if
  specific extensions misbehave.

### ~~Phase 1 — Stop the "buttons don't work" feel~~ (shipped)

Shipped as commit `0b7242e`. Items wired:

- Clickable breadcrumb segments in all three directions.
- Direction B rail items navigate (Home / Downloads / Docs).
- Direction C sidebar Pinned items navigate.
- Direction C drives populated from `fs.listDrives()`.
- Direction A drives section (new) also driven by `fs.listDrives()`.
- Fluent window controls (─ ☐ ✕) call
  `Neutralino.window.minimize() / maximize() / unmaximize() / app.exit()`.

Still pending: compile `extras/shellhelp.exe` on a Windows box with
MSVC. Until then, drive list / properties / delete fall back to
PowerShell (~250–400 ms) and the new shell context menu silently
degrades to the curated-only list.

### ~~Phase 3 — Folder background right-click + resizable panes~~ (shipped)

**3a · Empty-space context menu.** `pane.js`'s `renderRows` now
listens for `contextmenu` on the `.rows` container itself (and
`.rows__empty`); the new `showFolderContextMenu(x, y, pane)` opens
a folder-scope menu (Open in VS Code · Open in Terminal · New folder ·
Refresh · Show in Explorer · Properties) and async-fills shell
extensions via `helperMenu([pane.path])`. `app.js` added a
`refresh` action and `reveal` falls back to `openInOS(pane.path)`
when nothing is selected. A new `onPaneActivate` opt on
`renderRows` activates the right pane before opening the menu so
dispatched actions don't target the wrong pane.

**3b · Resizable panes.** New `src/layout.js` owns `LAYOUT_DEFS` +
`DEFAULT_SPLITS` + `applyLayout(grid, layoutId, splits, paneCards, onChange)`,
which sets the grid template with a 6 px gutter track, places each
card by explicit `grid-column / grid-row`, and inserts splitter divs
in the gutter tracks. Drag mutates the grid template directly each
frame (clamped 0.1 – 0.9) and commits the ratio on mouseup;
`onChange` persists `settings.splits[layoutId]` and re-renders. Both
directions now go through `applyLayout`; `pane3rdAware` folded in.

### ~~Phase 2 — Real multi-tabs per pane~~ (shipped)

Each Fluent pane carries a `tabs` array (path / history / selection /
entries / filter per tab); active-tab fields are mirrored on the pane
object so existing nav/render code is unchanged. `pane.js` exports
`tabNew` / `tabClose` / `tabSwitch` / `tabSnapshot`; `app.js`
persists `panes[].tabs[].path` + `activeTabIdx` under
`simple-explorer.tabs`; `directions/fluent.js` renders the real tab
bar. Closing the last tab is a no-op (the × is hidden) — coupling
tab close to layout shrink stays in Phase 6.

### ~~Phase 4 — Cmd palette + tab affordances + resize smoothness~~ (shipped)

Cmd Ctrl+K palette lives in `src/palette.js`; modes (`command`,
`path`, `search`) are inferred from the query prefix. `app.js`
gained `tabNew` / `tabClose` `doAction` shims so the palette can
dispatch tab operations via the existing `explorer:action` channel,
and a global Ctrl+K binding focuses the palette input when Cmd is
active. Fluent tabs now close on middle-click. Pane resize
mousemove updates coalesce to one per animation frame and suppress
`.row` pointer events during the drag.

### ~~Phase 5 — Sort + view modes~~ (shipped)

Each tab now carries its own `sort: { key, dir }` and `view`
(`details` / `compact` / `tiles`). `pane.js` exports
`sortedEntries(state)` (folders cluster first, then comparator by
key); `filtered()` now sorts before filtering. Persistence:
`tabSnapshot` now returns `[{ path, sort, view }]` and
`createPaneState` accepts both legacy string seeds and the new
object shape. Fluent: column-header cells (`cols__seg`) are
clickable — same-key click toggles asc/desc, different key
switches and resets to asc. Fluent command bar gained an `a-view`
segmented chooser before the layout picker. Cmd: pane-header
Sort and View buttons open generic `.popover` overlays anchored
under the button. Compact = same grid as details with denser
padding; Tiles = wrapping flex grid of 92×88 px cells (column
header hidden in Tiles). Tree and Column view stay deferred to
Phase 7.

### ~~Phase 6a — Quick UX wins~~ (shipped)

- **Esc clears selection** in the active pane (`bindGlobalKeys`
  augmentation; existing type-jump-buffer clear stays).
- **Status-bar selection size sum.** New `selectionSizeLabel(pane)`
  in `pane.js` totals bytes of selected files; both `a-statusbar`
  and `b-pane__foot` show the result. Folder-only selections show
  nothing; mixed (file + folder) selections suffix `(files only)`
  to flag that folder size needs a recursive walk we don't do.
- **F2 inline rename.** New `pane.renaming` field; when set,
  `renderRows` substitutes the row's `<span class="row__label">`
  with an autoFocused `<input class="row__rename">` (basename
  pre-selected, extension preserved). Enter commits via
  `fs.rename`; Esc / blur cancels. Replaces the previous
  `prompt()` modal.
- **Ctrl+L → palette in path mode.** `openPalette` accepts an
  optional `initialQuery`; the global keydown handler maps Ctrl+L
  to opening / focusing the palette with the active pane's path
  pre-filled (cursor at end). Cmd dispatches an `input` event so
  the palette's path-completion mode kicks in.
- **`npm run build` post-step** — `scripts/copy-helper.mjs` copies
  `extras/shellhelp.exe` into `dist/simpleexplorer/extras/` after
  `neu build`. Idempotent; silently skips when the helper isn't
  built yet.
- **Cmd rail redesign** (from Claude Design handoff). Drop the
  Pinned section; five vertical icon + label items (Home, Recent,
  Downloads, Docs, Drives) on a 64 px rail. Click any non-Home
  item opens a 200 px detail panel listing entries inside that
  category — Recent reads from `getRecent()`; Drives reads from
  `ctx.drives`. Click an entry to navigate the active pane; click
  the same rail icon to close. Default open: `Recent`.
  Persisted under `settings.cmdRailOpen`.

### ~~Phase 6b.1 — Pane-activation refactor~~ (shipped)

`setActivePane()` no longer triggers a full `render()`. New
`applyActivePane(i)` in `app.js` toggles the active class on existing
pane cards (looked up by `data-pane-idx`) and rebuilds Fluent's
global `.a-statusbar` in place — no row DOM teardown. The
`e.stopPropagation()` workaround on `pane.js`'s row click is gone:
a single click in a non-active pane now both selects the row *and*
activates the pane, and double-clicking a folder in a non-active
pane opens it without the "click chrome first" detour. Cmd's
per-pane `b-pane__foot` is unaffected — it shows that pane's own
stats and doesn't depend on which pane is active.

### ~~Phase 6b.2 — Drag-and-drop between panes~~ (shipped)

HTML5 DnD wired in `src/pane.js`: rows are `draggable`, the rows
container handles `dragenter` / `dragover` / `dragleave` / `drop`.
A module-scope `activeDrag` cache holds the in-flight payload so
`dragover` can pick a same-drive vs cross-drive cursor (HTML5
hides dataTransfer values during drag, only the types list is
visible). `dragstart` selects the dragged row if it wasn't already
in the selection — matches stock Explorer. Modifier keys override
the default: Ctrl forces copy, Shift forces move; otherwise
same-drive = move, cross-drive = copy.

Drops route through a new `ctx.onDrop(srcIdx, dstIdx, names, op)`
in `app.js` that calls `fs.copy` / `fs.move` per item, reloads
both panes via `safeLoad`, and activates the destination pane so
post-drop state is sane. `fs.sameDrive(a, b)` (drive-letter
compare on normalized paths) lives next to the existing path
helpers. `text/uri-list` is also stuffed onto `dataTransfer` —
free groundwork for the Phase 7 OS-DnD work.

Visual cue: `.rows--drop` adds an inset accent ring + tinted
background while a foreign drag is over the destination pane;
an enter/leave depth counter avoids flicker as the cursor
crosses child elements.

### Phase 7 — Larger features (sequenced)

The flat list of "deferred" Phase 7 items is now broken into seven
sub-phases (7a–7g), ordered cheapest-and-most-visible first,
helper-dependent work batched together, terminal last because it is
the largest single bet. Total ~14–16 days. Each sub-phase ships on
its own `feat/phase-7…` branch off `origin/main` with a single
commit per CLAUDE.md's branch policy.

Summary:

| Sub-phase | Feature | Size | Helper? | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7a | Mica + frameless chrome | 1d | no | low |
| 7b | Recursive search | 2d | no | low |
| 7c | OS DnD (drop side) | 1d | no | low |
| 7d | File preview pane (text/img/md/PDF) | 2d | no | low |
| 7e | Thumbnails + DnD egress (helper batch) | 3d | **yes** (new verbs) | med |
| 7f | Tree view | 2d | no | med (layout) |
| 7g | Integrated terminal | 3–5d | **yes** (ConPTY verb) | high |

#### 7a — Mica + frameless chrome (~1 day)

Smallest, most-visible, no helper / FS work. Closes the gap with
Direction A's design intent.

- Set `borderless: true` in `neutralino.config.json`.
- Custom title-bar component in `src/directions/fluent.js` with
  `Neutralino.window.setDraggableRegion` for the drag area; existing
  `─ ☐ ✕` controls stay (already wired in Phase 1).
- Apply Mica via WebView2's backdrop hint where available
  (`Neutralino.window.setMicaEffect()` if exposed; otherwise CSS
  acrylic/blur fallback for older Windows builds and non-Win11).
- Risk: Mica needs Win11 22H2+. Detect at runtime via `NL_OS` /
  build number; degrade to flat acrylic gracefully.

#### 7b — Recursive search (~2 days)

Pure JS over `Neutralino.filesystem.readDirectory`. Slots into the
existing palette (Cmd) and search input (Fluent). No helper work.

- New `src/search.js` with a cancellable async walker:
  BFS queue, chunked yields (~16 ms slice budget), AbortController
  for cancel. Skips reparse points and obvious noise (`node_modules`,
  `.git`) only when explicitly opted in via a settings toggle —
  default is "search everything visible".
- Cmd palette: when query has no `>`, `/`, `\`, or `<X>:` prefix and
  there's an active pane, palette flips to a "Search inside <pane
  path>…" mode after Enter.
- Fluent: existing `.searchInput` already filters visible rows on
  type; add Enter to escalate to a recursive walk. A new results
  view replaces the rows grid until cleared (Esc / clear button).
- Filename match only in v1 (substring, locale-aware,
  case-insensitive). Hit highlighting via a wrapper span around the
  matched substring.
- Cancel triggers: new keystroke, pane navigation, Esc, switching
  directions, switching panes.
- Out of scope: content search, regex, glob include/exclude UI.

#### 7c — OS DnD drop side (~1 day)

Receive drops from stock Explorer. The egress half (drag *out* of
SimpleExplorer) needs the native helper and is deferred to 7e.

- Wire `dragenter` / `dragover` / `drop` on the rows container in
  `src/pane.js` (already partially in place from 6b.2 for in-app
  drags).
- Read `dataTransfer.types`; when `Files` or `text/uri-list` is
  present, treat as a foreign drop and route through the existing
  `ctx.onDrop()` from 6b.2 with copy as the default and Shift = move.
- Drive-letter compare via `fs.sameDrive` decides cursor (already
  exists from 6b.2).
- Visual cue reuses the `.rows--drop` accent ring from 6b.2.
- Egress (dragging files *from* SimpleExplorer into Explorer)
  intentionally deferred — needs `DoDragDrop` in the helper. See 7e.

#### 7d — File preview pane (~2 days, includes PDF + markdown)

Right-side toggleable preview pane. No helper work. Establishes the
side-panel layout we'll reuse for thumbnails.

- New right-side pane in `src/directions/fluent.js` and
  `src/directions/cmd.js`, ~320 px default width, draggable splitter
  reusing `applyLayout`'s gutter mechanic. Toggleable via `Ctrl+P`
  and a Fluent command-bar button / Cmd rail icon. Persist toggle
  state per direction under `settings.preview.open`.
- New `src/preview.js` dispatch:
  - **Text** (`.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.log`,
    `.csv`, source files): chunked read, first 1 MB, monospace.
  - **Image** (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`,
    `.ico`): `<img src="file:///…">`.
  - **Markdown** (`.md`): rendered HTML via a tiny inlined
    markdown-it (or hand-rolled CommonMark subset — heading, bold,
    italic, code, lists, links, images). Sandboxed (no script
    execution); links open via `Neutralino.os.open`.
  - **PDF** (`.pdf`): rendered via [`pdf.js`](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)
    embedded as a vendored `extras/pdfjs/` (or via the Mozilla CDN
    behind `Neutralino.extensions` if offline use isn't required).
    First-page render only in v1; pager controls deferred.
  - **Other** (binary / unknown): kind icon + size + modified date.
- Updates on selection change in the active pane (debounced 80 ms
  to avoid thrash during arrow-key navigation).
- Out of scope for v1: video / audio playback, syntax highlighting,
  diff view, multi-page PDF navigation.

#### 7e — Native helper batch: thumbnails + DnD egress (~3 days)

Both need new C++ verbs in `tools/shellhelp.cpp`; batched to share
build/test cycles.

- **Thumbnails** (`thumb` verb): `IShellItemImageFactory::GetImage`
  → emits PNG bytes on stdout (or a small temp file path printed to
  stdout for cleanliness; helper deletes on exit).
  - JS-side LRU keyed `path|mtime|requestedSize`; default cache 256
    entries, evict oldest. Tiles view consumes first; details view
    keeps kind icons (perf).
  - Async fill pattern from Phase 1.5 (curated first, helper fills
    in) — render kind icon synchronously, replace with thumb when
    helper returns.
  - Fallback: when helper missing, return early — kind icons stay.
- **DnD egress** (`dragout` verb): construct an `IDataObject` with
  `CF_HDROP` for the selected paths and call `DoDragDrop` with
  `DROPEFFECT_COPY | DROPEFFECT_MOVE`. The helper blocks while the
  user holds the mouse; on drop it returns the chosen effect on
  stdout so JS can decide whether to refresh the source pane.
  - JS triggers via `os.execCommand` on `dragstart` when the cursor
    is moving toward outside the app window. Detection heuristic:
    if `dragend` fires with `dataTransfer.dropEffect === 'none'` and
    the cursor is outside the window bounds, escalate to helper.
    (Cleaner alternative: always escalate; HTML5 in-app DnD from
    6b.2 stops working — too disruptive. Stick with the heuristic.)
- `tools/build.md` updated with the new verbs.
- `docs/design.md` "Native helpers" table extended.

#### 7f — Tree view (~2 days)

Sidebar tree of folders rooted at drives. Virtualized so 50 k+ node
trees stay snappy.

- New `src/tree.js`: windowed render — only the rows currently
  inside the scroll viewport are present in the DOM, padded with a
  spacer above/below to preserve scrollbar geometry. Row height
  fixed (24 px) so virtualization math stays trivial.
- Expand / collapse persists to `simple-explorer.tree.expanded` (set
  of paths). Lazy-loads children on first expand.
- Click a node = navigate the active pane to that folder.
  Right-click = same context menu as a row (curated + shell extensions
  via `helperMenu`).
- Sidebar gains a tab-style switcher between Tree / Quick access.
  Default keeps quick access (current behavior); user opt-in to tree.
- Risk: large drives / network shares can stall on initial
  enumeration. Mitigation: `readDirectory` per node is already
  async; show a spinner per row.

#### 7g — Integrated terminal in Direction B (~3–5 days)

Largest, riskiest single feature. Cmd direction only; the Fluent
skin keeps "Open in Terminal" as an external spawn.

- **Frontend:** [`xterm.js`](https://xtermjs.org/) (same emulator
  VS Code uses) rendered into a resizable bottom panel below
  `b-grid`. Toggleable via `Ctrl+\`` and a Cmd rail icon. Multiple
  terminals as tabs.
- **Backend:** new `pty` verb in `tools/shellhelp.cpp` wrapping
  the Windows [ConPTY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/creating-a-pseudoconsole-session)
  APIs (`CreatePseudoConsole`, `ResizePseudoConsole`,
  `ClosePseudoConsole`). Spawns the chosen shell under the PTY and
  pipes bytes both ways.
- **Shell selection** (matches VS Code): on first launch, detect
  shells in PATH (`pwsh.exe` → `powershell.exe` → `cmd.exe` →
  Git Bash → WSL); one-time quick-pick overlay; persist to
  `simple-explorer.terminal.shell`.
- **Working directory** (matches VS Code): new terminals open at
  the active pane's current path; thereafter independent — they do
  not follow pane navigation. Folder right-click gains "Open in
  integrated terminal".
- **IPC:** bidirectional bytes via `Neutralino.os.spawnProcess` +
  `events.on('spawnedProcess', …)`; stdin via
  `os.updateSpawnedProcess`. Resize events flow as JSON control
  messages on a sentinel-prefixed line.
- **Out of scope (v1):** split terminals, search, profile UI beyond
  the first-launch picker, session restore across app restarts.
- **Risks:** ConPTY escape-sequence translation imperfect (some
  TUI apps misbehave on resize); chunked output may need a 16 ms
  flush coalesce. Cheap fallback for Windows < 1809: plain
  `os.spawnProcess` without PTY semantics — works for line-oriented
  commands, breaks for vim/less.

### Phase 8 — Polish, scaling, real terminal (sequenced)

Where Phase 7 was a feature-breadth push, Phase 8 is the cleanup
and scaling pass. Five sub-phases, total ~10.5 days. Ordered by
user impact: 8a fixes the only place the app feels visibly slow
(shipped), 8b unlocks the deferred terminal upgrade (reverted —
see the dedicated section), 8c stops silent data-overwrite
footguns, 8d closes the keyboard-ergonomics gap, 8e replaces the
WebView2-native `prompt()` / `confirm()` dialogs that break the
Mica chrome whenever the user clicks New / Delete.

| Sub-phase | Theme | Size | Helper? | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8a | Listing perf + tree virtualization | 2d | no | low |
| 8b | Helper rebuild + ConPTY + xterm.js | 4d | **yes** (new `pty` verb) | high |
| 8c | Copy/move polish: progress, conflict, cancel | 2d | no | med |
| 8d | Selection keyboard ergonomics | 1d | no | low |
| 8e | In-app dialogs for command-bar buttons | 1.5d | no | low |

#### ~~8a — Listing perf + tree virtualization~~ (shipped)

Two related "things slow down on big trees" fixes, batched.

- **Big-directory listing** (`src/fs.js`). `fs.listDir` now skips
  the per-entry `getStats` round-trip on first paint for folders
  above `EAGER_STAT_THRESHOLD` (200 entries); it emits
  name + is_dir + extension immediately, sorts folders-first by
  name for a deterministic first paint, and back-fills size +
  modified asynchronously in chunks of 100 (`EAGER_STAT_CHUNK`).
  Each chunk yields to the event loop and fires an optional
  `onProgress` callback. Small folders keep the eager
  `Promise.all` path so navigation into a typical user directory
  is unchanged. `loadPath` in `src/pane.js` wires an
  `AbortController` per pane so navigating away cancels an
  in-flight fill, and dispatches `explorer:entries-updated` on
  each chunk; `src/app.js` `bindEntriesUpdates` coalesces those
  into one `render()` per animation frame (and defers while the
  palette is open, mirroring the search scheduler's hazard).
- **Tree virtualization** (`src/tree.js`). The tree now walks
  the open tree into a single flat `visibleNodes` array and
  renders only the rows in the current viewport ± 8 with fixed
  24 px row height. An outer `tree-inner` div carries
  `height = visibleNodes.length * ROW_HEIGHT` to preserve
  scrollbar geometry; each visible row is `position: absolute`
  with `top = idx * ROW_HEIGHT`. Scroll, expand/collapse, and
  async child loads (loading / empty pseudo-rows) all funnel
  through one `rebuild()` → `renderWindow()` pair.
  `lastScrollTop` is preserved at module scope so the
  parent direction's full re-render of the sidebar doesn't
  reset the scroll position. A `ResizeObserver` re-paints once
  the container is mounted with a real `clientHeight`. The
  sidebar wrapper switched to `display: flex; flex-direction:
  column` so the tree (and a new `.a-sidebar__body` wrapper for
  Quick mode) own scrolling instead of the outer `.a-sidebar`.
- Out of scope: lazy-load row stats inside the *tree* (it only
  shows folder names, no size/modified). Just the directory pane.

#### ~~8b — Helper rebuild + ConPTY + xterm.js~~ (reverted to external launchers)

The promised real terminal upgrade. Phase 7g shipped a
line-oriented stub that broke for vim / less / top; 8b delivered
a proper PTY-backed terminal — which then turned out to be unusable
under Neutralino's spawn context on Windows 11 build 26100. After
extended debugging (multiple console-state resets, focus-event
suppression, Win32 input-mode encoding, shell swaps) showed that
`WriteFile` to the PTY input pipe always succeeded and conhost
always drained the bytes, but no shell — `cmd.exe` or
`powershell.exe` — ever received them as console input records,
8b was reverted. The same `extras\shellhelp.exe pty cmd.exe`
binary worked end-to-end when launched manually from a real
PowerShell window, isolating the fault to Neutralino's `cmd /c`
spawn wrapper. With no path to fix that from app code, the embedded
terminal was removed and replaced with three external-launcher
actions (`Open in Terminal`, `Open in PowerShell`, `Open in Cmd`)
in `src/fs.js`. `xterm.js` vendor, `src/terminal.js`, and the
`pty` verb in `tools/shellhelp.cpp` are all gone.

The replacement surface (`fix/pty-free-console` branch):

- **Four launchers in `src/fs.js`.** `openInTerminal` (auto-detect
  wt → cmd fallback), `openInPowerShell`, `openInCmd` (no auto
  upgrade — explicit cmd intent), `openInBash` (Git for Windows
  bash, wt-hosted when available with `cd …; exec bash`).
- **Palette entries** in `src/palette.js`: "Open in Terminal" /
  "Open in PowerShell" / "Open in Cmd" / "Open in Git Bash". Each
  dispatches the matching action through the existing palette
  command channel.
- **Toolbar / rail dropdown.** The terminal icon in the Fluent
  toolbar and the Cmd direction's rail is a dropdown (via
  `showShellPickerMenu` in `src/pane.js`, reusing the right-click
  menu primitives) instead of a one-shot launcher. PowerShell /
  Command Prompt / Git Bash / "Open in Terminal" — Esc or
  outside-click dismisses the same way the right-click menu does.
- **Search no longer blocks the palette.** `runRecursiveSearch`
  re-renders the pane every 80ms while results stream in.
  `render()` wipes `#root.innerHTML` and rebuilds the topbar that
  hosts the palette input, so the palette overlay (which lives on
  `document.body`) ended up with listeners bound to a detached
  input — typing did nothing. The scheduler now skips the periodic
  re-render while `isPaletteOpen()` is true and re-checks every
  200ms; search keeps streaming into `pane.search.results`, and the
  final render once the palette closes shows everything.
- **Quieter `readDirectory` warnings.** Windows scatters
  `Application Data` / `Cookies` / `My Documents` / `Start Menu`
  reparse-point junctions across every user profile; their DACL
  denies list-folder and Neutralino returns `NE_FS_NOPATHE` /
  `NE_RT_NATRTER`. Those two codes now go to `console.debug`
  instead of `console.warn` so the dev console isn't flooded on
  every home-folder expansion — genuine errors still warn.
- **DevTools off in production.** `modes.window.enableInspector`
  flipped to `false`. `npm run dev` re-enables it via the runtime
  CLI override (`neu run -- --window-enable-inspector=true`),
  `npm run build` and `npm run start` ship without the inspector
  window.

Original shipped scope, kept for context:

Shipped on `feat/phase-8b-pty-terminal`:

- **`pty` helper verb** in `tools/shellhelp.cpp` wrapping
  `CreatePseudoConsole` / `ResizePseudoConsole` /
  `ClosePseudoConsole` (resolved at runtime via `GetProcAddress`
  so the binary still loads on Windows < 1809 — verb returns
  exit code 3 when ConPTY isn't present). Two `_beginthreadex`
  pumps move bytes between the helper's stdin/stdout and the
  PTY input/output pipes.
- **OSC-framed resize control.** JS injects
  `ESC ] SE_CTL ; resize ; <cols> ; <rows> BEL` on stdin; the
  helper's stdin pump scans for that prefix, intercepts the
  message, and calls `ResizePseudoConsole`. Everything else
  passes through to the PTY untouched. `PTY_CTL_PREFIX` /
  `PTY_CTL_TERM` constants kept in sync between
  `tools/shellhelp.cpp` and `src/terminal.js`.
- **xterm.js renderer.** Vendored offline at
  `src/vendor/xterm/` (core 5.5.0 + addon-fit 0.10.0 +
  addon-web-links 0.11.0; ~290 KB total, single-file UMD
  bundles). Loaded via plain `<script>` tags from
  `src/index.html`; no bundler step. `src/terminal.js`'s
  `<pre>` + input pair is replaced by `term.open(mount)` with
  `term.onData → helper.stdin` and `helper.stdout → term.write`.
- **Resize plumbing.** `ResizeObserver` on the mount node, rAF-
  coalesced, calls `fit.fit()` then `sendResize(tab)` so the
  helper sees the new grid before xterm finishes the paint.
- **No half-broken fallback.** Phase 7g's line-oriented v1 is
  gone. When `extras/shellhelp.exe` is absent, the panel shows
  a one-paragraph "build the helper or grab the CI artifact"
  notice instead of trapping the user in a stub that mangles
  vim. Cleaner failure mode than the original `usePty: false`
  toggle plan.
- **CI build pipeline.** A separate
  `ci/build-shellhelp` branch landed `.github/workflows/build-shellhelp.yml`
  so the helper is rebuilt on every change to `tools/shellhelp.cpp`
  via `windows-latest` + `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd`, uploaded as the
  `shellhelp` artifact, and pulled into `extras/` via
  `gh run download`. Removes the local-MSVC dependency that had
  been blocking 8b for weeks.
- **Tab history / completion / ANSI colors.** All handled by
  the shell now (real readline / PSReadLine / cmd doskey through
  the PTY) — the v1 client-side fakes are gone. vim, less,
  top, ssh password prompts, and tab completion all work.

#### 8c — Copy/move polish: progress, conflict, cancel (~2 days)

Today a multi-GB drag silently blocks the UI; a same-name drop
silently overwrites; there's no cancel. All three are foot-guns
on real-Windows usage.

- **Progress overlay.** A small toast/strip at the bottom of the
  active pane shows N of M items copied/moved with a byte
  progress bar. Wired into both internal pane DnD and foreign
  Explorer-drop paths (the `onDrop` / `onForeignDrop` handlers in
  `app.js`). The strip is dismissible and auto-fades on
  completion.
- **Conflict resolution.** When the destination already has a
  same-named entry, raise a small modal: Skip / Replace / Keep
  Both (auto-rename to `name (2).ext`) / Cancel. "Apply to all"
  checkbox to handle large batches. Default action: Skip
  (safest); Enter binds to the highlighted button.
- **Cancellation.** Each in-flight operation gets an
  AbortController; the progress strip's × button signals it. The
  copy loop checks the signal between files. Partial state is
  left as-is (no rollback in v1) — the user can finish manually.
- Out of scope: pause/resume, post-completion "show in Explorer"
  hint, copy-to-clipboard-then-paste flow (separate phase).

#### 8d — Selection keyboard ergonomics (~1 day)

The selection model (`pane.selected: Set<string>`) supports
multi-select via Ctrl/Shift+click but has no keyboard shortcuts.
Closes the gap with stock Explorer.

- `Ctrl+A` selects every visible row in the active pane.
- `Shift+ArrowDown` / `Shift+ArrowUp` extend the selection from
  the anchor (last single-clicked row) one row at a time. Track
  `pane.selectionAnchor` so a fresh single-click resets it.
- `Home` / `End` move the focused row to first / last visible;
  `Shift+Home` / `Shift+End` extend the selection there.
- `Ctrl+Click` toggles individual rows (already works via the
  click handler) — no change, just verify it.
- All of this respects the focus-zone gate from the recent fix:
  shortcuts only fire when the active pane card has focus, not
  when the terminal does.
- Out of scope: rubber-band select (drag-to-select rectangle) —
  bigger UX change, separate phase.

#### 8e — In-app dialogs for command-bar buttons (~1.5 days)

The command bar's New / Copy / Rename / Delete / Compare /
"Drag out…" actions currently route through `prompt()` and
`confirm()` -- the WebView2 native dialogs. They show as
`127.0.0.1:58681 says…` chrome that breaks the Mica frameless
look completely (see Phase 7a's design intent), can't be themed,
and lock the entire app while open. Replace with in-app modals
that match the chrome.

- **`src/modal.js` (new):** small overlay primitive --
  `prompt({ title, label, value, validate })`,
  `confirm({ title, body, danger })`, and `choose({ title, body,
  options })` for multi-button cases. Returns Promises so callers
  stay async-await-shaped. Single-instance (re-opening tears down
  the previous overlay), Esc cancels, Enter submits, click-outside
  cancels (or doesn't, when `danger: true`).
- **Wire each command-bar action through it.** `app.js` doAction
  cases swap their `prompt()` / `confirm()` for the new
  primitive. The `New folder` action gets validation against
  invalid Win32 chars (`<>:"/\\|?*`), already-exists collision
  check, and a default-suggested name (`New folder`,
  `New folder (2)`, …) that's pre-selected so Enter accepts.
- **Trash confirm copy.** Today's `Move N item(s) to Recycle
  Bin?` becomes a styled modal with the items listed (capped at 5
  + "and N more"), a Recycle Bin icon, and a destructive accent
  on the OK button. Same shape for Permanently delete (Shift+Del).
- **Rename inline already exists** (Phase 6a's F2 inline editor)
  -- this phase doesn't change row-level rename. The command-bar
  Rename button still walks through the modal because the user
  may have multi-select; for single selection it could fall
  through to the inline editor (decide during implementation).
- **Style:** matches `.popover` / `.search-banner` -- 1 px
  border, 6 px radius, soft drop shadow, body in `var(--surface)`.
  Header has the title; body has the prompt + input; footer has
  Cancel + primary button right-aligned. Min width 360 px.
- **Visual button polish (drive-by).** While we're touching the
  cmd-bar buttons, the `.cmdbtn` style is currently flat-text;
  give it the same hover treatment as `.iconbtn`, swap the
  emoji-ish glyphs in `Copy` / `Rename` for properly-aligned
  iconHTML calls (most already use icons but `Compare` and
  `Delete` slightly drift). Same height (28 px), same accent on
  hover.
- Out of scope: a full settings / preferences pane (parked for a
  later polish pass); toast notifications for action results
  (success / failure feedback) -- just keep the existing console
  warns for v1.

### Phase 9 — Crew (Copilot CLI) integration

Wire the `crew` CLI from
[Eurus7895/CopilotCrew](https://github.com/Eurus7895/CopilotCrew/tree/dev)
into SimpleExplorer so a user can ask natural-language questions
about the file(s) they're looking at without leaving the explorer.
Crew is the terminal-native Copilot SDK assistant — `crew "what
does this file do"` runs a routed LLM call; agents, pipelines, and
skills are reachable via `--agent`, `--pipeline`, `/<skill>`. We
shell out to the binary; we do **not** import its Python or vendor
its SDK.

Three sub-phases, total ~4 days. 9a is the spine; 9b makes it
useful for the explorer-specific case; 9c is the polish that
turns the surface into something users will reach for.

| Sub-phase | Theme | Size | Helper? | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9a | Spawn `crew` and stream output | 1.5d | no | low |
| 9b | File-context injection + right-click action | 1.5d | no | low |
| 9c | Skill / agent quick-pick + output drawer | 1d | no | med |

**Out of scope across the whole phase:**
- Bundling Crew or its Python runtime. We assume `crew` is on
  the user's `PATH`; if not, the integration shows a one-shot
  "Crew not found — install via `pipx install copilotcrew`"
  notice and stays out of the way. No silent install attempts.
- Crew's `gui` mode (it has its own desktop interface). We don't
  embed or compete with that; we just expose the CLI.
- Auth flow inside SimpleExplorer. Crew handles its own GitHub
  Copilot login on first run — we surface stderr so the user
  sees the device-code prompt and resolves it externally.
- Pipeline editing / agent authoring. We *invoke* what's in
  `~/.crew/`; we don't manage it.

#### 9a — Spawn `crew` and stream output (~1.5 days)

The minimum viable path: a "Crew" panel that can run `crew
"<prompt>"` and show streaming stdout. Reuses Phase 7g's terminal
infrastructure rather than rolling a new IPC layer.

- **`src/crew.js` (new)** — wraps `Neutralino.os.spawnProcess`
  around the `crew` binary. Exports `runCrew({ args, onChunk,
  signal })` returning a Promise; chunks come from
  `events.on('spawnedProcess', …)` in 16 ms-coalesced batches.
  AbortSignal cancellation maps to `os.updateSpawnedProcess(…,
  'exit')`.
- **Detect availability.** On boot, `where crew` (or `which crew`
  fallback). Cache the result; the rail icon shows disabled with
  a tooltip "Install crew via pipx install copilotcrew" when
  missing.
- **Reuse the terminal panel chrome.** Crew runs as a special
  tab type alongside the existing shell tabs — `tab.kind:
  'crew' | 'shell'`. Crew tabs render with a different prompt
  (`crew >`) and the input maps Enter to `runCrew(['"' + line +
  '"'])` instead of stdin. The `<pre>` history shows the streamed
  output verbatim.
- **First-class shortcut.** `Ctrl+Shift+\`` opens or focuses a
  Crew tab (mirrors Ctrl+\` for shell).
- **Cancellation.** Esc inside a running Crew tab signals abort;
  the helper-side process is killed, the partial output is kept
  in scrollback with a `[cancelled]` marker.

#### 9b — File-context injection + right-click action (~1.5 days)

Make Crew aware of *what file the user is looking at*. The whole
point of integrating with an explorer is the explorer-specific
context.

- **Right-click → "Ask Crew about this"** on selected files /
  folders. Single file: prepends `--direct "Reading file: <path>.
  "` to the user's prompt. Multi-select: lists the paths.
  Folder: passes the directory and a tree summary (capped at 200
  entries).
- **`@` mention syntax inside the Crew tab input** — typing `@`
  opens an inline picker (reuses Phase 4's palette positioning)
  with files from the active pane's current directory. Picking
  one inserts its absolute path. Saves the user from typing long
  paths in prompts.
- **`Ctrl+Shift+A` from anywhere** = "Ask Crew about active
  pane's selection." If selection is empty, falls back to the
  current pane path.
- **Folder-as-context limits.** Folder mentions don't read every
  file's content (would blow the LLM context window) — they pass
  the path string. Crew's own MCP tools fetch content if its
  router decides it needs to.

#### 9c — Skill / agent quick-pick + output drawer (~1 day)

Surface what Crew already exposes so users don't have to memorize
flags.

- **Slash-command palette inside the Crew tab.** Typing `/` at
  the start of an input opens a picker listing skills found in
  `~/.crew/.github/skills/` and agents in `~/.crew/.github/
  agents/`. Selection inserts the canonical
  `--agent <name>` / `/<skill>` flag; user adds the prompt and
  hits Enter.
- **Output drawer.** Crew writes to `~/.crew/outputs/` for any
  pipeline that produces files. Add a small footer button in
  the Crew tab: "Open last output" (navigates the active pane to
  the most-recent file in `~/.crew/outputs/`). Saves a manual
  `cd`.
- **Recent prompts.** Up/Down arrow already navigates terminal
  history (Phase 7g); Crew tabs share the same per-tab history,
  so `↑` recalls the last prompt.
- **Status line.** Bottom-right of the panel shows "crew vX.Y |
  agent: <last> | turn N/cap" parsed from Crew's stderr signals
  if available, otherwise empty.

#### Risks / gotchas
- **PATH discovery.** `crew` is installed via `pipx`, which
  drops it in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\
  pipx\venvs\…`. `where crew` finds it only if pipx ran
  `ensurepath`. Need to fall back to a couple of well-known
  locations before declaring it missing.
- **Streaming format.** Crew's stdout might be plain text or it
  might emit ANSI / token-chunked output. We treat it as plain
  text for v1; if we see escape sequences we cope with them in
  9c by piping through a tiny ANSI stripper (the embedded
  xterm.js path that Phase 8b would have provided was reverted —
  see the 8b retrospective — so there's no in-process VT
  renderer to lean on).
- **Auth on first run.** Crew shows a device-code URL in stderr.
  We display stderr inline so the user can copy the URL — no
  in-app browser flow.
- **Long answers vs the panel.** Crew responses can be paragraphs.
  The panel's `<pre>` already wraps with `white-space: pre-wrap`
  (Phase 7g), so this works; just verify the 4 MB ring buffer
  doesn't truncate mid-answer.

## Open questions / debt

- **Context menu overflows the viewport.** With many installed shell
  extensions (Bosch File Services, FastSearch, SWB-Shell, IntelliJ,
  Git, 7-Zip, Toolbase, TortoiseSVN, …) the right-click menu can be
  taller than the window and gets clipped at the bottom — entries
  below the fold are unreachable. No max-height / overflow scroll
  on `.context-menu`; the open-anchor logic in `showContextMenu`
  / `showFolderContextMenu` checks horizontal overflow but not
  vertical. Fix: cap menu height at `viewport - 16 px`, add
  `overflow-y: auto`, and flip the anchor upward when
  `menu.bottom > viewport.height`. Same fix applies to submenus.
- **Shell-extension load can stall the menu.** `helperMenu` walks
  `IContextMenu` for every installed extension; a slow / RPC-heavy
  extension can hold up the whole right-click for seconds. The
  Phase 1.5 spec called for a 1 s watchdog returning partial
  results plus an optional per-CLSID skip-list in
  `neutralino.config.json` — neither is wired today. The helper
  also doesn't cache per-CLSID timings so repeat slowness can't
  be predicted away. Tracked separately from the menu-overflow
  fix because it needs `tools/shellhelp.cpp` changes + a CI
  helper rebuild.
- **`extras/shellhelp.exe`** isn't compiled yet. Until you have MSVC
  installed and run `scripts/run.ps1` once, Properties / Delete /
  drives stay on the slow PowerShell path.
- **Vendored Neutralino runtime** in `bin/neutralino-win_x64.exe` is a
  scratch-branch workaround for the corporate-proxy block on
  `github.com`. If this branch ever gets cleaned up for `main`, the
  binary must come out and the proxy issue must be solved upstream.
- **No tests at all.** CLAUDE.md prescribes `tests/` but JS test
  tooling isn't wired. First test target probably should be `fs.js`'s
  pure helpers (`joinPath`, `parentPath`, `pathSegments`,
  `formatSize`, `formatModified`).
- **CSS lives in one 19 KB `styles.css`.** As directions grow this will
  fight us; consider splitting per-direction once Phase 2 lands.
